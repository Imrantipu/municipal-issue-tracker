# Project Requirements Document
## Public Infrastructure Issue Reporting System

**Version:** 3.0 (Mid-Level Quality + German Market Standards)
**Last Updated:** December 25, 2024
**Target Market:** German Tech Companies (Mid-Level Portfolio)
**Development Approach:** Agile/Incremental with TDD + Clean Architecture
**Quality Focus:** Production-Grade MVP with Mid-Level Engineering Practices

---

## 1. Project Overview

**System Name:** Public Infrastructure Issue Reporting System

**Purpose:** A digital platform that enables citizens to report real-world public infrastructure issues (broken streetlights, potholes, water leakage, garbage overflow, damaged footpaths, etc.). Government staff and admins can manage, verify, assign, and resolve reported issues efficiently.

**Business Value:**
- Improves municipal response time
- Increases transparency in public service delivery
- Provides data-driven insights for infrastructure planning
- Reduces citizen frustration with unresolved issues

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** Citizens (issue reporters)
- **Secondary:** Municipal Staff (issue resolvers)
- **Tertiary:** System Admins (platform managers)

---

## 2. MVP Strategy (German Market Approach)

### 2.1 MVP Philosophy

**German companies value:**
- ✅ Working software over comprehensive features
- ✅ Code quality over speed
- ✅ Test coverage over quick delivery
- ✅ Documentation over assumptions
- ✅ Security and privacy from day one

**MVP Goal:**
Build a **fully functional, well-tested, production-ready** core system that demonstrates professional software engineering practices. Better to have 5 features done perfectly than 20 features done poorly.

### 2.2 MVP Scope (Build THIS for Portfolio)

**Phase 1 - MVP Features (4-6 weeks):**

#### Must-Have (Core Value Proposition):
1. **Authentication System**
   - Email/Password registration & login
   - JWT-based authorization
   - Role-based access control (3 roles)
   - Session persistence
   - ❌ Skip Google OAuth (add later)

2. **Issue Reporting (Citizen)**
   - Create issue (title, description, category, location)
   - ❌ Skip image upload initially (add later)
   - View own issues
   - Edit own issues (if status=pending)
   - Delete own issues

3. **Issue Management (Admin/Staff)**
   - Admin: View all issues
   - Admin: Assign issues to staff
   - Staff: View assigned issues
   - Staff: Update issue status
   - Status flow: Pending → In-Progress → Resolved → Closed

4. **Basic Timeline Tracking**
   - Record status changes
   - Display timeline on issue details page
   - Show who made changes and when

5. **Dashboards (Basic)**
   - Citizen: Issue count statistics
   - Staff: Assigned issues list
   - Admin: System overview stats

6. **Core Infrastructure**
   - Responsive design (mobile-first)
   - Error handling
   - Loading states
   - Input validation
   - **80% test coverage minimum**

#### Explicitly EXCLUDE from MVP:
- ❌ Payment system (boost/subscription)
- ❌ Google OAuth
- ❌ Image upload (use placeholder images)
- ❌ Upvote system
- ❌ PDF generation
- ❌ User blocking
- ❌ Staff management CRUD
- ❌ Advanced filtering
- ❌ Charts/graphs

**Rationale:** MVP focuses on core workflow: Report → Assign → Resolve. **Quality over quantity** demonstrates mid-level engineering maturity.

---

### 2.3 Mid-Level Quality Touches (What Makes This Stand Out)

**These practices elevate your portfolio from entry-level to mid-level:**

**1. Clean Architecture (Hexagonal/Onion)**
- Domain logic separated from infrastructure
- Dependency inversion principle
- Easy to test, easy to change
- Demonstrates architectural thinking

**2. Comprehensive Testing (85%+ Coverage)**
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API + DB
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Test-first development (TDD)

**3. Database Optimization**
- Proper indexing strategy
- Query performance analysis (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- N+1 query prevention
- Connection pooling configuration

**4. Monitoring & Observability**
- Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Performance metrics
- Health checks

**5. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**
- Automated testing on every push
- Automated deployment to staging
- Code quality checks (SonarQube)
- Security scanning

**6. Docker (Local Development)**
- Docker Compose for full stack
- Consistent development environment
- Easy onboarding for reviewers
- Production-like setup locally

**7. API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)**
- Interactive API documentation
- Request/Response examples
- Error codes documented
- Try-it-out feature

**8. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**
- Document WHY you made decisions
- Show thinking process
- Demonstrates maturity
- German companies love this

**9. Performance Benchmarks**
- Load testing results
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Database query performance
- Frontend metrics (Lighthouse)

**10. Security Audit (OWASP Checklist)**
- OWASP Top 10 addressed
- Security headers configured
- Input validation comprehensive
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Impact:** These practices show you think like a mid-level engineer, not just code like a junior.

### 2.4 Post-MVP Enhancements (After Job Search)

**Phase 2 - Enhanced Features (Can add on the job):**
- Image upload (Cloudinary integration)
- Payment integration (boost/subscription)
- Google OAuth
- Upvote system
- Advanced search & filters
- PDF invoice generation
- User management (block/unblock)
- Charts and analytics
- Notifications (email/push)

| Test Coverage | 80% | **85%+** | JaCoCo (Backend), Jest (Frontend) |
| Code Duplication | <5% | **<2%** | SonarQube |
| Cyclomatic Complexity | <10 per method | **<5** | SonarQube / CodeClimate |
| Code Review | 100% PRs | 100% | GitHub PR process |
| Documentation | All public APIs | **+ ADRs + diagrams** | JavaDoc, TSDoc, ADR |
| Maintainability Index | >65 | **>80** | SonarQube |
| Technical Debt Ratio | <5% | **<2%** | SonarQube |

**Mandatory Practices:**

        /\
       /E2E\      10% - End-to-End (Critical user flows)
      /------\
     /Integration\ 30% - Integration (API + DB)
    /------------\
   /   Unit Tests \ 60% - Unit (Business logic)
  /----------------\
```

**Backend Testing (Spring Boot):**
- ✅ Unit Tests: JUnit 5 + Mockito

3. Assign issue (admin role)
4. Update status (staff role)
5. View timeline
6. Authorization failures (401/403)
7. Input validation failures (400)

**Target:** **85%+ coverage before deployment (Mid-Level Standard)**

**TDD Workflow (Test-Driven Development):**
1. Write failing test first (Red)
2. Write minimum code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor while keeping tests green (Refactor)
4. Repeat

**Test Quality Requirements:**
- ✅ Tests must be readable (Given-When-Then pattern)
- ✅ Tests must be isolated (no dependencies between tests)
- ✅ Tests must be fast (<5s for unit test suite)
- ✅ Integration tests use TestContainers (real PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Mocks used only when necessary
- ✅ Test names describe behavior, not implementation

### 3.3 GDPR Compliance (German Law)

**Required for German Market:**

1. **Data Privacy**
   - Store only necessary user data
   - Password hashing (BCrypt, min 10 rounds)
   - No logging of sensitive data (passwords, tokens)

2. **User Rights (Basic Compliance)**
   - Users can delete their account
   - Users can export their data (future)
   - Clear privacy policy (future)

3. **Security**
   - HTTPS only (production)
   - Secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
   - JWT token expiration (15min access, 7 day refresh)

**Total MVP Endpoints:** 16 (manageable and testable)

### 6.4 Clean Architecture Implementation (Hexagonal Architecture)

**What is Clean Architecture?**
- **Domain** (core business logic) is independent of frameworks
- **Application** (use cases) orchestrates domain
- **Infrastructure** (database, web) depends on domain
- **Dependency Rule:** Inner layers don't know about outer layers

**Why for Mid-Level Portfolio?**
- Shows architectural maturity
- Easy to test (domain has no framework dependencies)
- Easy to change (swap database, swap framework)
- German companies love this approach

**Layer Structure:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Infrastructure (Adapters)        │  ← Controllers, Repositories, Config
│  ┌──────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │   Application (Use Cases)    │  │  ← Service interfaces, DTOs
│  │  ┌────────────────────────┐  │  │
│  │  │   Domain (Entities)    │  │  │  ← Pure business logic
│  │  └────────────────────────┘  │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

Dependencies point inward →
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Domain logic is framework-agnostic (pure Java)
- ✅ 100% unit testable without mocks
- ✅ Easy to switch database (PostgreSQL → MongoDB)
- ✅ Easy to add new delivery mechanisms (REST → GraphQL)

### 6.5 Folder Structure (Clean Architecture)

```

**Key Principles:**
1. **Domain** doesn't depend on anything (pure Java)
2. **Application** depends on Domain (orchestrates use cases)
3. **Infrastructure** depends on Application & Domain (implements adapters)
4. **Dependency Inversion:** Infrastructure implements ports defined in Domain

## 7. Development Workflow (German Best Practices)

### 7.1 Git Workflow

**Branch Strategy:**
```
main (production)
└── develop (integration)
    ├── feature/auth-login
    ├── feature/issue-create
    └── bugfix/timeline-sorting
```

**Commit Message Convention (Conventional Commits):**
```
feat(auth): implement JWT login endpoint
fix(issue): prevent unauthorized edit
test(issue): add integration tests for creation
docs(readme): update setup instructions
refactor(service): extract timeline logic
```

**Pull Request Process:**
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement feature with tests (TDD preferred)
3. Run tests locally (must pass)
4. Push and create PR
5. Self-review checklist:
   - ✅ Tests pass
   - ✅ No console errors
   - ✅ Code formatted
   - ✅ Documentation updated
6. Merge to `develop`
7. Deploy `develop` to staging (optional)
8. Merge `develop` to `main` for production

### 7.2 Definition of Done (German Standard)

A feature is **DONE** when:

**Code:**
- ✅ Implementation complete per acceptance criteria
- ✅ Code formatted (Prettier/Checkstyle)
- ✅ No compiler warnings
- ✅ No unused imports/variables
- ✅ Code reviewed (self-review minimum)

**Testing:**
- ✅ Unit tests written and passing
- ✅ Integration tests written (where applicable)
- ✅ Coverage target met (80%+)
- ✅ Manual testing completed
- ✅ No regressions in existing features

**Documentation:**
- ✅ JavaDoc/TSDoc for public methods
- ✅ README updated (if needed)
- ✅ API documentation updated
- ✅ Comments for complex logic

**Deployment:**
- ✅ Merged to main branch
- ✅ Deployed to production
- ✅ Verified in production environment
- ✅ No errors in production logs

## 8. Mid-Level Quality Implementation Details

### 8.1 Docker Setup (Local Development)

**Why Docker for Local Development?**
- Consistent environment across team (German companies use this)
- Easy for reviewers/interviewers to run your project
- Production-like setup locally
- No "works on my machine" problems

**docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    container_name: issuetracker-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: issuetracker
      POSTGRES_USER: dev
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: devpassword
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U dev"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: issuetracker-backend
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL: jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/issuetracker
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME: dev
      SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD: devpassword
      JWT_SECRET: dev-secret-key-minimum-256-bits-long
    depends_on:
      postgres:
        condition: service_healthy
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
    command: ./mvnw spring-boot:run

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    container_name: issuetracker-frontend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: http://localhost:8080
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    command: npm run dev

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

**Backend Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN chmod +x mvnw
CMD ["./mvnw", "spring-boot:run"]
```

**Quick Start README section:**
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <repo-url>

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

**What Reviewers See:**
- ✅ Professional setup
- ✅ One command to run entire stack
- ✅ No environment setup needed

### 8.2 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**Why CI/CD?**
- Automated testing on every push
- Code quality checks
- Prevents bugs from reaching main branch
- Shows professional workflow understanding

**.github/workflows/backend-ci.yml:**
```yaml
name: Backend CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:15-alpine
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: test_db
          POSTGRES_USER: test
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: test
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s

### 8.3 Monitoring & Observability

**Why Monitoring?**
- Production readiness demonstration
- Shows you think about operations, not just development
- German companies expect this from mid-level engineers

**Spring Boot Actuator Setup:**

**application.yml:**
```yaml
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health, info, metrics, prometheus, loggers
      base-path: /actuator
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: always
      probes:
        enabled: true
  metrics:
    export:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
    tags:
      application: ${spring.application.name}
      environment: ${spring.profiles.active}
```

**Available Endpoints (for portfolio demo):**
- `/actuator/health` - Health status (database, disk space)
- `/actuator/metrics` - Performance metrics
- `/actuator/info` - App info
- `/actuator/prometheus` - Metrics for monitoring tools

**Structured Logging (JSON format):**

**logback-spring.xml:**
```xml
<configuration>
    <appender name="JSON" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
        <encoder class="net.logstash.logback.encoder.LogstashEncoder">
            <includeMdcKeyName>traceId</includeMdcKeyName>
            <includeMdcKeyName>userId</includeMdcKeyName>
        </encoder>
    </appender>

    <root level="INFO">
        <appender-ref ref="JSON" />
    </root>
</configuration>
```

**Example Log Output:**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-25T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Issue assigned successfully",
  "logger": "com.project.issuetracker.application.service.IssueService",
  "thread": "http-nio-8080-exec-1",
  "traceId": "abc123",
  "userId": "user-456",
  "issueId": 789
}
```

**Frontend Performance Monitoring (Web Vitals):**

**src/lib/analytics.ts:**
```typescript
export function reportWebVitals(metric: any) {
  // Log to console in development
  console.log(metric);

  // Send to analytics in production
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
    // Send to your analytics endpoint
    fetch('/api/analytics', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(metric),
    });
  }
}
```

**What Reviewers See:**
- ✅ Production-ready monitoring
- ✅ Observable system (can see what's happening)
- ✅ Structured logs (easy to parse and search)

### 8.4 Performance Benchmarks

**Why Performance Benchmarks?**
- Shows you care about performance
- Demonstrates testing beyond functional requirements
- Mid-level engineers understand performance implications

**Load Testing with k6:**

**k6/load-test.js:**
```javascript
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export const options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '30s', target: 20 },  // Ramp up to 20 users
    { duration: '1m', target: 20 },   // Stay at 20 users
    { duration: '30s', target: 0 },   // Ramp down to 0 users
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<500'], // 95% of requests must complete below 500ms
    http_req_failed: ['rate<0.01'],   // Error rate must be below 1%
  },
};

export default function () {
  // Test GET all issues
  const res = http.get('http://localhost:8080/api/issues');

  check(res, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
  });

  sleep(1);
}
```

**Run:**
```bash
k6 run k6/load-test.js
```

**Document Results in README:**
```markdown

    http
        .headers(headers -> headers
            .contentSecurityPolicy("default-src 'self'")
            .xssProtection(xss -> xss.headerValue(XXssProtectionHeaderWriter.HeaderValue.ENABLED_MODE_BLOCK))
            .frameOptions(frame -> frame.deny())
            .httpStrictTransportSecurity(hsts -> hsts
                .includeSubDomains(true)
                .maxAgeInSeconds(31536000))
        );
    return http.build();
}
```

### 8.6 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Why ADRs?**
- Document WHY you made decisions
- Shows thinking process
- German companies LOVE this
- Demonstrates maturity

**ADR Template (`docs/adr/0001-use-hexagonal-architecture.md`):**
```markdown
# ADR 001: Use Hexagonal Architecture

**Date:** 2024-12-25
**Status:** Accepted
**Context:** Need to choose application architecture for issue tracking system
**Decision:** Implement Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters) Architecture

## Context

Building a full-stack issue tracking system that needs to:
- Be testable without framework dependencies
- Allow easy changes to database or delivery mechanism
- Demonstrate mid-level architectural thinking for German job market

## Decision

Implement Hexagonal Architecture with three layers:
1. Domain Layer (business logic, entities, ports)
2. Application Layer (use cases, DTOs, mappers)
3. Infrastructure Layer (adapters for web, database, external services)

## Consequences

### Positive
- Domain logic is 100% testable without mocks
- Easy to swap PostgreSQL for another database
- Easy to add GraphQL alongside REST
- Demonstrates architectural maturity to hiring managers
- Follows German market best practices

### Negative
- More files and folders (higher initial complexity)
- Requires discipline to maintain layer boundaries
- Slight learning curve for hexagonal concepts

### Mitigations
- Use ArchUnit tests to enforce layer dependencies automatically
- Document architecture clearly in README
- Provide examples in code comments

## Alternatives Considered

**1. Traditional Layered Architecture (MVC)**
- Simpler to implement
- Database entities used directly in controllers
- Rejected: Harder to test, tight coupling to framework

**2. Microservices**
- Better scalability
- Rejected: Overkill for portfolio project, increases complexity

## 13. Summary: What Makes This Mid-Level Quality

### Features vs Quality Comparison

| Aspect | Entry-Level Approach | **This Project (Mid-Level)** |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Features** | Many features, basic quality | **Core features, exceptional quality** |
| **Architecture** | MVC layers | **Hexagonal Architecture** |
| **Testing** | Some tests, ~50% coverage | **TDD, 85%+ coverage** |
| **CI/CD** | Manual deployment | **GitHub Actions pipeline** |
| **Monitoring** | No monitoring | **Actuator + structured logging** |
| **Performance** | Not measured | **Load tested + benchmarked** |
| **Security** | Basic auth | **OWASP Top 10 addressed** |
| **Documentation** | Basic README | **README + ADRs + API docs** |
| **Local Dev** | Manual setup | **Docker Compose (1 command)** |
| **Code Quality** | Works | **SonarQube scanned, <2% duplication** |

### What German Hiring Managers Will See

**In Your GitHub:**
- ✅ Clean Architecture (not just MVC)
- ✅ 85%+ test coverage badge
- ✅ Green CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Comprehensive README with benchmarks
- ✅ ADRs showing your thinking
- ✅ SonarQube quality gate passing

**In Interviews:**
- ✅ Can explain architectural decisions (ADRs)
- ✅ Can discuss performance (load test results)
- ✅ Can demonstrate monitoring (Actuator endpoints)
- ✅ Can show security awareness (OWASP checklist)
- ✅ Can explain testing strategy (TDD process)

**On Live Site:**
- ✅ Loads fast (<3s, Lighthouse 95+)
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Docker Compose for easy local setup
- ✅ Swagger UI for API exploration

### Why This Stands Out

**Entry-level portfolios typically have:**
- Many features
- Low test coverage
- No CI/CD
- No monitoring
- No performance benchmarks
- Simple architecture

**This portfolio demonstrates:**
- ✅ **Production thinking** (monitoring, logging, performance)
- ✅ **Quality focus** (85% tests, SonarQube, security audit)
- ✅ **Architectural maturity** (hexagonal architecture, ADRs)
- ✅ **Professional workflow** (CI/CD, Docker, code quality gates)
- ✅ **Operational awareness** (observability, benchmarks)

**Result:** Hiring managers recognize this as **mid-level quality work**, not entry-level.

## 14. FINAL NOTE FOR GERMAN MARKET

**German companies value:**
1. **Quality over speed** - Take time to do it right
2. **Testing** - Not optional, it's mandatory (85%+)
3. **Documentation** - They WILL read your README, ADRs, and code
4. **Clean code** - They WILL review your GitHub architecture
5. **Honesty** - Mention limitations, don't hide them
6. **Production thinking** - Show you understand operations, not just development

**This MVP strategy:**
- ❌ NOT about having the most features
- ✅ About demonstrating **professional engineering practices**
- ✅ About showing **mid-level thinking** despite being entry-level experience
- ✅ About **quality that impresses** hiring managers

**Key Differentiator:**
> "Entry-level developers show they can code. Mid-level developers show they can engineer."

**This project positions you as an engineer, not just a coder.**

**Timeline:**
- **Weeks 1-6:** Core features with mid-level quality practices
- **Weeks 7-8:** Polish, documentation, benchmarks, deploy
- **Total:** 6-8 weeks to job-application-ready portfolio
- **Then:** Start applying while you continue learning

**Expected Outcome:**
A portfolio that makes German hiring managers think:
> "This candidate writes code like someone with 2-3 years experience, not a fresh graduate. Let's interview them."
